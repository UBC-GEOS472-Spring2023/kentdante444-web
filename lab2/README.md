# Precipitation Forecast 

So, I made this cool interactive map that shows the precipitation forecast for the next 72 hours in the United States. It's basically for anyone who wants to stay on top of the weather and plan their activities accordingly. I tried to keep the interface easy to use and intuitive by incorporating interactivity that allows users to toggle between different layers of information, like radar and satellite imagery, to get a more comprehensive understanding of the forecast.

I chose to use a color gradient to represent precipitation levels, with the darker shades indicating heavier precipitation. I think it makes it super easy for users to see which areas are going to get hit the hardest. And, to make sure everyone knows what they're looking at, I included a legend to explain the color-coding system I used.

While there's always room for improvement, like adding more detailed information about temperature and wind speed or making the map zoomable, I'm pretty happy about how it turned out. So, if you're ever planning a hike or outdoor activity, make sure to check out my map and stay dry!
